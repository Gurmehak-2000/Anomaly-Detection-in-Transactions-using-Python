# Anomaly-Detection-in-Transactions-using-Python
Anomaly detection in transactions means identifying unusual or unexpected patterns within transactions or related activities. These patterns, known as anomalies or outliers, deviate significantly from the expected norm and could indicate irregular or fraudulent behaviour. If you want to learn how to detect anomalies in transactions, this is for you.

Anomaly Detection in Transactions: Process We Can Follow Anomaly detection plays a crucial role in various businesses, especially those dealing with financial transactions, online activities, and security-sensitive operations.

We can follow a systematic process to address the challenge of anomaly detection. We can begin by collecting and preparing transaction data, ensuring its accuracy and consistency. Then, we can find patterns in the data to find anomalies and use specialized anomaly detection algorithms like isolation forest to detect anomalies.

So the process starts with data collection. I have found an ideal dataset that can be used for detecting anomalies in transactions.
